WEBSITE DEPLOYMENT GUIDE - HELMICK UNDERGROUND
===============================================

You need to upload all your website files to your hosting service where HelmickUnderground.com is registered.

STEP 1: GATHER YOUR FILES
--------------------------
You need to upload these files from C:\Users\Admin\HelmickUnderground:

✓ index.html
✓ about.html
✓ services.html
✓ contact.html
✓ thank-you.html
✓ styles.css
✓ script.js
✓ logo.png (if you have it)
✓ images/ folder (with your equipment photos when ready)

DO NOT UPLOAD:
- EMAIL_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.txt
- DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.txt
- README files


STEP 2: ACCESS YOUR HOSTING
----------------------------
Since you own HelmickUnderground.com, you likely have hosting through:
- GoDaddy (most common)
- Hostinger
- Bluehost
- SiteGround
- Or another provider

To access your hosting:

FOR GODADDY:
1. Go to: https://www.godaddy.com/
2. Click "Sign In" (top right)
3. Enter your GoDaddy account credentials
4. Click "My Products"
5. Find "Web Hosting" and click "Manage"
6. Click "cPanel" or "File Manager"

FOR OTHER HOSTS:
1. Check your email for hosting login credentials
2. Look for "cPanel login" or "hosting dashboard" link
3. Login with your credentials


STEP 3: UPLOAD FILES USING FILE MANAGER
----------------------------------------
Once in cPanel or File Manager:

1. Navigate to "public_html" or "www" folder
   (This is where your website files go)

2. DELETE any existing files in there:
   - index.html (old one)
   - Any placeholder pages

3. UPLOAD YOUR FILES:
   - Click "Upload" button
   - Select all files from C:\Users\Admin\HelmickUnderground
   - Wait for upload to complete (should take 1-2 minutes)

4. VERIFY the files are there:
   - You should see: index.html, about.html, services.html, contact.html, styles.css, script.js


STEP 4: UPLOAD USING FTP (ALTERNATIVE METHOD)
----------------------------------------------
If you prefer using FTP software (more reliable for multiple files):

SOFTWARE OPTIONS (pick one):
- FileZilla (free): https://filezilla-project.org/
- WinSCP (free): https://winscp.net/
- Cyberduck (free): https://cyberduck.io/

FTP CREDENTIALS (get from your hosting provider):
- Host/Server: Usually ftp.helmickunderground.com or helmickunderground.com
- Username: Your hosting username (check hosting email)
- Password: Your hosting password
- Port: 21 (standard FTP) or 22 (SFTP/secure)

STEPS:
1. Install FTP software (FileZilla recommended)
2. Open FileZilla
3. Click File > Site Manager > New Site
4. Enter your FTP details:
   - Host: ftp.helmickunderground.com
   - Port: 21
   - Protocol: FTP or SFTP
   - Username: (from hosting)
   - Password: (from hosting)
5. Click "Connect"
6. Navigate to "public_html" folder on the right side
7. Drag and drop all your files from left side (your computer) to right side (server)


STEP 5: TEST YOUR WEBSITE
--------------------------
After uploading:

1. Open browser
2. Go to: https://helmickunderground.com
3. If you see your website - SUCCESS! 🎉
4. Test all pages:
   - Click Home, Services, About, Contact
   - Submit a test form on Contact page
   - Check mobile view (resize browser or use phone)

If you see "Page Not Found" or old content:
- Wait 5-10 minutes for DNS to update
- Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Try in Incognito/Private window


STEP 6: ENABLE HTTPS/SSL (IMPORTANT FOR SECURITY)
--------------------------------------------------
Your website should use HTTPS (secure).

In cPanel:
1. Find "SSL/TLS Status" or "Let's Encrypt SSL"
2. Click "Run AutoSSL" or "Install SSL Certificate"
3. Select your domain: helmickunderground.com
4. Click "Install" or "Enable"
5. Wait 2-5 minutes for installation

Most hosting providers offer FREE SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt).
