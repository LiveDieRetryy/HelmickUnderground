GITHUB TOKEN SETUP FOR GALLERY ADMIN
=====================================

To make the gallery admin work for everyone, you need to create a GitHub Personal Access Token 
and add it to Vercel. This allows the admin to automatically update the gallery-data.json file.

STEP 1: CREATE GITHUB PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN
--------------------------------------------
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "Helmick Underground Gallery Admin"
4. Set expiration: "No expiration" (or 1 year if you prefer)
5. Select these scopes:
   ☑ repo (Full control of private repositories)
     - This gives access to commit files
6. Scroll down and click "Generate token"
7. **IMPORTANT**: Copy the token immediately (starts with ghp_...)
   You won't be able to see it again!

STEP 2: ADD TOKEN TO VERCEL
----------------------------
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/livedieretryyy/helmick-underground/settings/environment-variables
2. Click "Add New" (or "Add Environment Variable")
3. Fill in:
   - Key: GITHUB_TOKEN
   - Value: [Paste your GitHub token here]
   - Environment: Production, Preview, Development (select all 3)
4. Click "Save"

STEP 3: REDEPLOY
----------------
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/livedieretryyy/helmick-underground/deployments
2. Find the latest deployment
3. Click the "..." menu → "Redeploy"
4. Wait 30 seconds for deployment to complete

STEP 4: TEST IT
---------------
1. Go to: https://helmickunderground.com/admin
2. Login (username: admin, password: HUAdmin)
3. Add a test item
4. Check https://helmickunderground.com/gallery
5. The item should appear for EVERYONE (not just you!)

SECURITY NOTES:
---------------
- Never share your GitHub token
- The token is stored securely in Vercel's environment variables
- Only the admin page can use it to update the gallery
- Regular visitors can't access or modify the gallery

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
Q: "Failed to add item" error?
A: Make sure the GITHUB_TOKEN is added to Vercel and you've redeployed

Q: Gallery not updating?
A: Check that the token has "repo" scope permissions

Q: Token expired?
A: Create a new token and update it in Vercel environment variables

WHAT THIS DOES:
---------------
- When you add an item in the admin, it makes an API call to /api/gallery
- The API uses your GitHub token to update gallery-data.json on GitHub
- GitHub automatically triggers Vercel to redeploy
- Everyone sees the new item within 30 seconds!

NO MORE MANUAL GIT PUSH NEEDED! 🎉
