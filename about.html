                    <p><strong>Helmick Underground LLC is a proud family-owned and operated business with deep roots in Iowa.</strong> Our story begins in 1988 when Jerry Helmick purchased his first plow and founded Triple J Construction. Together with his wife Joyce Helmick, they embarked on a journey that would shape the underground utility industry in our region.</p>
                    <p>Jerry and Joyce built their business from the ground up, working as independent contractors for Bell Telephone Company, and later for Quest and CenturyLink. As their own bosses, they established a reputation for quality workmanship, reliability, and dedication that became the foundation of our company's values.</p>
                    <p>Over the decades, what started with a single plow has expanded into a full-service underground utility company with state-of-the-art equipment and expertise across multiple specialties. From fiber optic installation to directional drilling and comprehensive excavation services, we've grown to meet the evolving needs of our industry.</p>
                    <p>Today, Jerry and Joyce's legacy continues as their two sons, Tommy and Travis Helmick, have taken the helm of the company. Building on the solid foundation their parents established, Tommy and Travis are bringing fresh perspectives and new innovations while maintaining the same commitment to excellence and customer satisfaction that has defined Helmick Underground for over three decades.</p>
                    <p>Looking to the future, Tommy and Travis are committed to not only growing the business but preserving it as a family legacy for generations to come. Their vision is to build upon the success their parents achieved and create something meaningful to pass down to their own children—ensuring that the Helmick name remains synonymous with quality underground utility services in Iowa for many years ahead.</p>
                    <p>As a family business, we treat every project with the same care and attention we would give our own property. Our commitment to quality workmanship, safety, and customer satisfaction has made us the preferred choice for residential, commercial, and municipal projects throughout Iowa.</p>
