- Always click "Logout" when finished
- Never share your password

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
Q: Image not showing in gallery?
A: Make sure the image file is uploaded to the images/ folder first

Q: TikTok video not appearing?
A: Make sure you copied the FULL embed code from TikTok, including <blockquote> tags

Q: Changes not showing on website?
A: Did you replace gallery-data.json and push to GitHub? Vercel needs 30 seconds to deploy.

Q: Forgot to download gallery-data.json?
A: No problem! Just re-add your items. The download happens after each change.

WORKFLOW SUMMARY:

1. Login to admin at /admin
2. Add items (images or TikTok videos)

6. Wait 30 seconds for Vercel to deploy
7. Check helmickunderground.com/gallery

TIPS:
-----
- Add project photos regularly to show your work
- Use descriptive titles (e.g., "Fiber Optic Install - Mount Vernon")
- Keep descriptions concise but informative
- TikTok videos auto-play when scrolled into view
